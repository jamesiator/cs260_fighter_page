# cs260_fighter_page
This was a project done in fall 2020 for CS 260 (web programming class).

A simple website for running simulated "battles" between randomly-chosen characters that the user has created.
Uses a vanilla Vue.js frontend and an express.js backend, with a Mongo db instance for storing data.
